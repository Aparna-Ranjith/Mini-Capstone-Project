Mini Capstone Project on Covid Diagnosis- Great Learning Assessment

The World Health Organization has emphasised the need for comprehensive testing in order to fight the virus. With the lack of testing kits available worldwide, there is a call for novel testing methods that can help arrest the spread faster[3]. Every health care worker exposed to the virus puts additional pressure on an already outstretched infrastructure. Here, in this study we propose a machine learning approach towards predicting Covid-19 cases among a sample population who have undergone other clinical tests and blood spectrum tests. The samples were collected during a hospital visit for a suspected case of Covid-19. 

The patient data used in this effort has been donated by Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, at SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil for the purpose of research. The data is anonymized and the samples were collected between 28 March - 3 April, 2020. The problem at hand is divided into two parts : 

1. Predict confirmed COVID-19 cases amongst suspected cases based on the laboratory tests of their clinical samples. 
2. Predict admission to general, semi-ICU, and ICU wards among those who predicted positive for COVID-19 in the first task.

### Notebooks:
1. Data Cleaning -- Preprocessing the initial Dataset to remove null values
2. Prediction_Blood_Dataset -- Predicting Covid-19 in  pateints on the basis of blood test attributes
3. Visualization -- EDA on the final dataset
4. Prediction_Extended_Dataset -- Predicting the occurence of Covid-19 on the basis of blood test and other attributes forming an extended dataset
5. Admission to Wards -- Predicting the admission to Regular ward, Semi-ICU, or ICU based on severity

### Data
All the data used can be found in the Datasets folder.
